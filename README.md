# Project Name

## Overview

This project is a DevOps infrastructure automation solution that focuses on deploying and managing multiple AWS EC2 instances. The infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform, which ensures consistent and repeatable deployments. 

Ansible is used to automate the configuration and deployment processes, including setting up Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) and configuring monitoring using Grafana. This setup is designed to simplify and streamline the deployment pipeline, enabling efficient management of cloud resources.

## Key Components

- **Terraform**: Used to define and provision the cloud infrastructure on AWS. It ensures that the infrastructure is versioned, consistent, and easily reproducible.
- **Ansible**: Handles the configuration management and application deployment, ensuring that the EC2 instances are properly configured and all necessary services (like Jenkins and Grafana) are running.
- **Jenkins**: Automates the CI/CD pipeline, allowing for seamless code integration and deployment.
- **Grafana**: Provides monitoring and visualization of the infrastructure, helping to maintain operational visibility and performance tracking.

## Future Enhancements

- Additional configuration management for more advanced monitoring with Prometheus.
- Integration with other cloud services (like S3 or RDS) to expand the infrastructure capabilities.
- Advanced security configurations and automated testing pipelines.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have the necessary tools installed: Terraform, Ansible, Docker (for Jenkins and Grafana), and AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions.

Further instructions on setting up the project and running the deployments will be added as the project evolves.
